She added that the student, a man in his 20s, is currently “doing quite well” and is being quarantined at his home, which is not in a dorm on campus.
He is being monitored by public health nurses who are calling him regularly.
“We won’t release him from isolation until we are satisfied it’s safe to do so,” said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences.
“He returned to Boston directly from China through Logan Airport.
He returned on the 28th of January, recognized quickly that he was ill and sought medical attention.
He had only been ill for a brief period of time when he arrived,” Madoff said.
“Active screening had not yet begun at Logan at that time.” The patient had a runny nose when he arrived in Boston, health officials said, and has been in isolation since he sought medical care on Jan. 29.
Madoff said he could count the patient’s close contacts “on our fingers,” and contacts are household members and medical personnel who treated the man.
All public health officials on the call emphasized that the overall risk to residents in Massachusetts remains low.
The eighth confirmed US case of the coronavirus is a “member of the UMass Boston community,” the school said in a statement today.

The Defense Department expects to announce today that 11 additional military housing locations have been approved to accept people for quarantine if public health authorities believe there are coronavirus concerns, according to two US officials.
The request for the additional military housing has come from the Department of Health and Human Services and has been preliminarily approved by the Pentagon.

The expectation is relatively small numbers of people will have to be housed as they come off those commercial flights, officials said.
Health authorities will be in charge of making those decisions.
The request estimates about 20 beds per site may be needed.

Robin Shattock, the head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, told The Brief’s Bianca Nobilo that his team was sharing information with teams of scientists across the world in the race to develop a workable vaccine.
“The earliest a vaccine could possibly [be] available for global use would be early next year.
That sounds slow – it’s still faster than it’s been done before.” Shattock also told CNN that “basic hygiene methods [were] the most effective ways to reduce transmission” of coronavirus.
He added that wearing masks only provided limited protection from the infection.
“The evidence that masks are protective is very slim,” he said.
“We don’t have strong evidence that they do much in terms of protection…they might reduce transmission just because it prevents you touching your face more often.” Shattock said use of masks by members of the public could cause stock shortages in hospitals.""

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA today, involved analyzing data on 138 patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
The data showed that hospital-related transmissions of the virus were suspected in about 41% of the patients.
Specifically, 40 health care workers in the study and 17 patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons were presumed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the hospital, the data showed, also revealing that 26% of all the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit and 4.3% died.
The researchers noted that the new study, to their knowledge, might be the largest case series to date of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia — but the study had some limitations.
Hospital-related transmissions of infections ""could not be definitively proven but was suspected and presumed based on timing and patterns of exposure to infected patients and subsequent development of infection,” the researchers wrote in the study.
Among the 138 cases, ""most patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission.
About one in six people under investigation for Wuhan coronavirus in the United States have had “close contact” with someone confirmed to have been infected, according to a report released today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 11% had contact with another person under investigation had not yet been confirmed to have the virus.
The majority, about 70%, had only travel-related risk.
Of them, most had traveled to Wuhan, versus other parts of China.
The numbers come from 210 people who were under investigation from Jan. 21 to Jan. 31, when CDC updated its guidelines.
All of the people were symptomatic — typically with fever and respiratory symptoms — and thus tested for the virus.
The CDC says these numbers are likely to change.
""Because person-to-person transmission is expected to continue, and as further travel restrictions are implemented, it is likely that the proportion of [people under investigation] with such contact risk in the United States will increase,” the report says.
On Friday, the CDC posted its latest total of people under investigation since January 21: A total of 337 people in 36 states.
This includes 12 who have tested positive, 225 negative and 100 are still pending.
A 58-year-old man and a 42-year-old man are the latest people to contract coronavirus in Hong Kong, bringing the total to 26 confirmed cases as of 8 p.m. local Friday, according to the Department of Health.
The 58-year-old is in serious condition.
According to the patient's information, he was traveling back and forth for work from Macao to his home in Zhuhai during the incubation period and then resided with a friend in Hong Kong.
The 42-year-old is in stable condition.
He had flown to Hebei Province and visited Macao before returning to Hong Kong.
A domestic worker who resided with him presented symptoms and will be sent to Prince of Wales Hospital and a quarantine is being arranged for his friend who lived with him but is asymptomatic."	2020-02-07

The global death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus is at least 805, surpassing the number of fatalities from the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak.
When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) swept through the region, it infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774.
Like SARS, this latest outbreak is caused by a coronavirus, a family of viruses common to animals that range from the common cold, to more serious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Both the SARS and Wuhan outbreaks started in China -- and both are believed to have originated from wild animal markets.
The coronavirus death toll in the Chinese province of Hubei has risen to 780, according to the local health authority.
That's an increase of 81 people from the day before.
The total number of confirmed cases in Hubei jumped to 27,000.
There are more than 20,000 patients hospitalized in Hubei province and 1,154 are in critical condition.
Manchester United's newest signee Odion Ighalo will not join his teammates for training camp in Spain because travel restrictions linked to the coronavirus may prevent him from returning to England, the team's manager said.
The 30-year-old joined the Premier League club in a deadline day loan from Shanghai Shenhua and arrived in Manchester from China only in the past 14 days.
”Because of the situation in China, we're not sure if he'd be allowed back into England if he leaves the country again, so he's staying here working with a personal coach, individual programme and his family then can settle in England as well.
That's a plus,"" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told the team's in-house TV station.
An American couple was planning to finally pick up their adopted daughter in China this weekend.
Now, the process is on hold due to novel coronavirus.
After two years of paperwork, Ivy and Noah Cleveland had a room, a crib and clothes ready to welcome 3-year-old Ruby into their Georgia home.
“This was the first time in my life that I truly wept to the point of being sick in my body,” Ivy Cleveland told CNN.
""I just laid over her bed, over her crib that I had prepared for her and look up at the pictures in the wall, and her clothes in her closet, understanding that this is not happening right now.” Last month, the State Department issued the highest-level warning not to travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak and recommended that US citizens defer travel for adoption purposes.
“We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens defer travel to China for adoption purposes and that prospective adoptive parents contact their adoption service providers to discuss future plans,” the department said on January 31.
The Clevelands are unsure when they will able travel to China, but said they are not ready to give up their adoption process.
“I know this is just a part of our story, it’s part of Ruby’s story and how incredible will it be to tell her ‘look what we did to fight for you,’” Noah Cleveland said.
About 213 people, including Canadian citizens and their families, who were evacuated from Wuhan have returned to Canada, officials said.
“I want to thank everyone who helped bring these Canadians home safely.
They have undoubtedly undergone a stressful situation and we are thankful that they are back in Canada,"" Health Minister Patty Hajdu said in a statement.
The group traveled in a Canadian chartered plane and a second flight led by the United States.
The evacuees were placed in a 14-day quarantine at the Canadian Forces Base Trenton in Ontario.
None of them have shown symptoms of novel coronavirus, authorities said.
The World Health Organization will send an international team to investigate the coronavirus outbreak to China, with the team leader leaving for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva on Saturday.
Ghebreyesus said the rest of the experts on the team will follow “after that.��� When asked whether the international team will include officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ghebreyesus said, “We hope so.” From Dr. Tom Frieden A study published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that 41% of the first 138 patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, China, were presumed to be infected in that hospital.
In plain English, it means that nearly half of the initial infections in this hospital appear to have been spread within the hospital itself.
(Doctors use big words to hide bad things: Nosocomial means caught it in the hospital.) What's more, most spread doesn't appear to have been the result of a so-called ""super-spreader event,"" in which a single patient transmits infection to many other people.
In these — where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient's lungs — can result in many infections.
This would be a concern, but not nearly as much as what appears to have happened: Many health care workers and many patients got infected in many parts of the hospital.
What's more, since there's a broad spectrum of infection and only patients who were sick were tested, it's quite likely that there was even more transmission in the hospital.
So, like SARS and MERS — other coronaviruses — before it, the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading in hospitals.
What does this mean?
The virus appears to be quite infectious, health care workers are at especially high risk, and we urgently need more information about just how infectious the virus is.
The virus might well be impossible to contain — just as the common cold and influenza can't be stopped, but the health and societal impacts can be blunted.
China's extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of the virus, even if unsuccessful, may slow its spread and improve China and the world's ability to limit the harm the virus causes.

The newly unveiled Trump administration budget proposal includes steep cuts for global health programs and the World Health Organization, even as the world grapples with the spread of the novel coronavirus.
However, it does increase its proposed funding for Global Health Security.
The FY21 Budget Proposal, released today, outlines a nearly $65M proposed cut to the World Health Organization – a more than 50% decrease from FY20 funding.
It also proposes a 34% overall cut to Global Health Programs.
It includes a proposed $115 million for Global Health Security aimed at enabling “the U.S. government, in partnership with other nations, international organizations, and public and private stakeholders, to prevent avoidable epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively to disease outbreaks and other critical infectious disease threats (including anti-microbial resistance) in an effort to prevent them from becoming national or global emergencies.” This is an increase of $25 million from last year’s request.
Asked by CNN about the impact the WHO cut could have on the global coronavirus response, the Director of the Department of State’s Bureau of Budget & Planning downplayed the potential negative consequences.
Jim Richardson, the Director of US Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the US was the “largest donor overall to global health around the world.” “We do think that it’s important to balance the multilateral against the bilateral assistance,” Richardson said.
“Both are important, but it is important for us to make sure that we get the appropriate reform to the multilateral while delivering the best assistance that we possibly can on the ground, and that’s often through bilateral.” Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun claimed that the budget bolsters “country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks and to prevent epidemics from reaching our borders.” “It also allows us to provide the necessary flexibility to respond to emerging global health threats such as the novel coronavirus and Ebola,” he said at the State Department.
Biegun praised the State Department and USAID efforts in responding to the novel coronavirus.

Health officials in Hong Kong are conducting a partial evacuation of residents from an apartment block following possibility that the coronavirus may have been transmitted via the building piping system, Professor KY Yuen said during an impromptu midnight press conference held on Tuesday morning local time.
Health officials have traced at least two confirmed cases of the coronavirus to the specific residential building called Hong Mei House in the Tsing Yi area of Hong Kong.
""As the pipeline that transfers feces is connected to the air pipe, it is very likely for the virus in the feces to be transmitted through the air fan into the toilet,"" Professor Yuen said.
Parts of the building were evacuated as a precaution while health officials and engineers carried out emergency checks, he added.
Professor Yuen said that the transmission route is not clear yet, so the evacuation was taken to protect the residents of the building.
This comes as local health officials confirmed that both the 42nd confirmed and latest case in the city and the 12th confirmed patient both lived in Hong Mei House.

""This will require the effort of all levels of government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together,” Messonnier said.
""One important aspect of this is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent spread of the disease, especially among health care personnel caring for patients.” Some of the steps the CDC has taken include speaking regularly with manufacturers of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment or PPE, such as face masks, to make sure that enough supplies are available in case they are needed.
""CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.
This virus is not spreading in the community,” Messonnier said.
But in an effort to make sure enough supplies are available in case of an outbreak in the United States, “CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE.
At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks,” Messonnier said.

The Leading Group of Beijing New Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic Prevention and Control Office, which made the announcement Thursday night (local time), said that any individual refusing to do so will be “held accountable according to law.” The novel coronavirus has spread throughout the world since the first cases were detected in central China in December, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Meanwhile, a number of countries, such as the United States and Japan, have evacuated their nationals on flights from Wuhan, capital of Hubei p\rovince and the epicenter of the outbreak.
Nearly 64,000 cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in mainland China since Dec. 31.
President Trump thanked the country of Cambodia for allowing a cruise ship to dock in the country.
The ship, which left from Hong Kong, had been rejected by several Asian ports over the last few days over fears of coronavirus.
About the ship: The Westerdam, which is owned by Carnival Corporation but sails under the Holland America brand name, was supposed to be taking a 14-day cruise around east Asia, beginning in Hong Kong on Feb. 1 and concluding Saturday in Yokohama, Japan.
But the governments of Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand refused the ship permission to dock over fears of the coronavirus epidemic — despite there being no confirmed cases on the ship.
Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen was on hand to welcome passengers disembarking in Sihanoukville today, and told reporters, ""The real problem for Cambodia is not news of the coronavirus outbreak, now called the COVID19.
But that is the sickness of fear."" Officials said ""full disembarkation"" will take a few days.
President Trump on Friday repeated the theory that the novel coronavirus will die out as temperatures rise in the spring, but scientists insist it’s just too soon to say for sure.
Several tell CNN it’s too early to tell, and nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior.
CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN in an interview, which aired Thursday, that the coronavirus may or may not be around past this year and it may or may not follow a seasonal variation — insisting only time will tell.
""We don't know a lot about this virus,"" he said.
""This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission."" Trump also estimated that there were “around 12” confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US.
As of Friday, 15 individuals tested by the CDC tested positive for the coronavirus.
US officials are working together to make a plan for Americans on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Friday.
There is no specific plan yet for the passengers, she said, but precautions are needed for the passengers — who may be at high risk from the novel coronavirus — and to avoid spread to others.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet returned to shipping coronavirus test kits to state labs after some tests were initially found to be faulty, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday during a call with reporters.
The CDC wants to make sure that “every T is crossed before we put these kits back out, so we’re taking a little extra time here,” Messonnier said.
Why this matters: Earlier this week, the agency said some state labs had been unable to validate the test.
The CDC is now remanufacturing a reagent used in the test that was yielding “indeterminate answers,” Messonnier said.
""What we’re doing at CDC is reformulating those reagents,” she said, ""and we are moving quickly to get those back out to our labs” with state and local partners.
Before it began shipping these kits, the CDC was the only lab in the United States that could test for the virus.
Experts say the new test kits open the door to confirming cases earlier, thus being able to take swift action to contain any further spread in the United States.
The CDC had previously announced plans to ship roughly 200 test kits to domestic labs and another 200 to international labs.
Each test kit can perform 700 to 800 patient samples.
Public health labs in five cities will begin using existing flu surveillance to look for the spread of the novel coronavirus, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call with reporters today.
Messonnier said this efficiently leverages the existing influenza surveillance systems to track whether the novel coronavirus is spreading in communities within the United States.
The labs will test for the coronavirus in samples that are negative for influenza.
Results from this will provide an early warning to trigger a change in the public health response, Messonnier said.
There have been 15 cases of the novel coronavirus confirmed in seven states: eight in California; two in Illinois; and one each in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas."	2020-02-14

Here’s how China's companies are trying to get back to business amid the outbreak.
The novel coronavirus has spread throughout the world since the first cases were detected in central China in December, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Meanwhile, a number of countries, such as the United States and Japan, have evacuated their nationals on flights from Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province and the epicenter of the outbreak.
More than 66,000 cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in mainland China since Dec. 31.
Here's a map showing where the confirmed cases are, according to data from the World Health Organization: The first case of coronavirus involving the Westerdam cruise ship was confirmed by Malaysia on Saturday, after an 83-year-old US citizen tested positive, according to a report from state media Bernama.
Several Asian countries refused to let the Westerdam dock in their ports before being allowed to disembark in Cambodia on Friday.
The cruise ship, which had a total of 1,455 guests and 802 crew onboard was not under quarantine, Holland America Line said last week.
All passengers and crew members onboard the cruise ship were allowed to return to their respective countries by the Cambodian government after they successfully passed through health screenings.
The US citizen and her husband, also American, were found to have symptoms as soon as they landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Cambodia, Bernama added.
They were referred to the Sungai Buloh hospital for examination, which concluded that the woman tested positive while her husband, age 85, tested negative.
The husband is still undergoing treatment and observation at the hospital for his symptoms.
The total tally of confirmed cases in Malaysia is now up to 22, according to a report from state media Bernama.
CNN has reached out to the State Department for a comment.
US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan will undergo extensive screening and a 14 day quarantine period should they choose to disembark.
On Saturday, US passengers received an email from the State Department urging them to leave the ship and return to the United States.
There are currently some 400 US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess.
The State Department will provide chartered flights for those who choose to leave.
Passengers choosing to fly back aboard the charter will be screened before they leave the ship and monitored by medical personnel during their return to the US, according to a news release from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Once back in the country, passengers will undergo a 14 day quarantine period at either Travis Air Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas.
The passengers returning from Japan will be housed separately from those evacuated from China at the same bases.
More context: So far at least 24 Americans aboard the ship have tested positive for the novel coronavirus aboard the ship.
Americans who have already tested positive for coronavirus, as well as those showing symptoms of the virus, will not be able to board the charter aircraft back to the United States, and will continue to receive treatment in Japan.
An American couple from Oregon who traveled in the Diamond Princess cruise ship that's docked at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama have had their hopes of coming home dashed.
Rebecca Frasure has tested positive for the virus, which means she can’t board a flight to the US and has to remain in quarantine at a nearby hospital.

There were 100 more deaths due to the coronavirus in China's Hubei province Sunday, the health authorities there said.
That raises the death toll at the center of the outbreak to 1,696.
The global death toll now stands at 1,770, with the vast majority of those deaths in mainland China.
More than 1,900 additional cases of the virus were confirmed Sunday, Hubei authorities said, bringing the total number of cases in the center of the outbreak to 58,182.
The global tally: There have been more than 71,204 cases of the virus recorded worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Authorities in the United States acknowledged reports that an 83-year-old American woman in Malaysia contracted the novel coronavirus while on a cruise ship, a State Department official said.
More than 300 passengers, mostly American citizens, from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are aboard the two airplanes chartered by the US government, a State Department spokesperson told CNN.
In its communications to passengers on the cruise ship Saturday, the US embassy in Tokyo said American citizens would be able to bring their non-American immediate relatives.
All travelers were screened for symptoms of coronavirus prior to departure and will be screened by staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention upon arrival in the United States, another State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
""Only those who were asymptomatic were allowed to board the flights,” the spokesperson said.
“Our primary goal remains ensuring the welfare and safety of all US citizens involved,” the spokesperson added.
“The Department of State has no higher priority than the welfare and safety of US citizens abroad.” Two airplanes chartered by the United States government to evacuate American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have departed Tokyo.
The first plane is heading to Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
The second plane is going to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, California.
The planes took off more than four hours after 10 buses brought the passengers from the cruise ship in Yokohama to Haneda Airport in Tokyo.
US officials have not discussed the number of people who asked for a seat on the charters.
Singapore has identified three new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the citywide total to 75 confirmed cases, the country's health ministry said.
None of those patients have traveled to China recently, the ministry said.
As of Sunday, a total of 19 patients have fully recovered from the virus and have been discharged from the hospital.
Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state -- where the first US case of Wuhan coronavirus was confirmed -- says the public should do ""what you do every cold and flu season."" That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
But don't use your hands.
Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately afterward.
WHO also recommends staying at least 3 feet or 1 meter away from anyone who may be infected.
Is there a cure for novel coronavirus?
No. Patients can be treated and may recover from their symptoms, but there is no known cure for the novel coronavirus yet.
A large group of Americans who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were spotted boarding a chartered flight at the Haneda Airport in Tokyo.

Hong Kong's Department of Health announced that it will prosecute two people suspected of violating compulsory quarantine requirements.
In a statement released on Monday, the Department of Health said that since the compulsory quarantine began on February 8, four Hong Kong residents under quarantine have attempted to leave Hong Kong in breach of the requirements.
The Department of Health added that following investigations, the department applied to serve summons to two of the people involved.
According to quarantine regulation, all travelers who have been in mainland China within 14 days preceding their arrival in Hong Kong must be subject to a 14-day quarantine.
If convicted of violating the quarantine regulation, the two Hong Kong residents face a maximum fine of $3,220 and up to six months in prison.
Five additional deaths were reported in mainland China on Monday, increasing the death toll there to 98, according to China’s National Health Commission (NHC).
Of the 98 deaths reported Monday, 93 were in Hubei Province.
The additional five deaths across all of mainland China brings the death toll to 1,868 in China.
That brings the global death toll to 1,873.
There have been five deaths reported outside of mainland China with one death in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the risk of coronavirus in the US is ""really very minimal because there really are only 15 cases now, in addition to those who were shipped here."" In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday, he went on to say the cases ""were identified, they were isolated and the contacts were traced.” He said the soonest a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could make it through the development process and clinical trials is “at least a year to a year and a half.” The Hubei health authority reported that 93 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Monday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 1,789.
This brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,863.
The global death toll is at least 1,868, with one death each in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 1,807 cases of the virus in Hubei on Monday, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 59,989.
According to the health authority, 41,957 patients have been hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,853 who are in critical condition.
The health authority said 7,862 patients have been discharged.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 73,243 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Concerns are mounting about how long the novel coronavirus may survive on surfaces — so much so that China's central bank has taken measures to deep clean and destroy its cash, which changes hands multiple times a day, in an effort to contain the virus.
It is unknown exactly how long the novel coronavirus can linger on contaminated surfaces and objects with the potential of infecting people, but some researchers are finding clues by studying the elusive behaviors of other coronaviruses.
About the virus: Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals.
In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Officials do not know what animal may have caused the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
But previously, studies have suggested that people were infected with the coronavirus MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, after coming in contact with camels, and scientists have suspected that civet cats were to blame for SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
These human coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces — including metal, glass or plastic surfaces — for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected, according to research published earlier this month in The Journal of Hospital Infection.
Cleaning with common household products can make a difference, according to the research, which also found that human coronaviruses ""can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite"" or bleach within one minute.
CNN's Randi Kaye, who is filling in for Anderson Cooper today on ""Full Circle,"" talks to an American who stayed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship instead of taking a charter flight to the US.

The Trump administration has prevented at least 140 travelers from entering the United States as it attempts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Fourteen foreign nationals were turned away at US airports and 126 people were refused entry at land ports from February 2 to 12, according to data provided to CNN by the Department of Homeland Security.
Additionally, 34 travelers were stopped at pre-clearance locations — airports where US officials conduct screening before passengers board US-bound flights.
More on this: On February 2, the US began implementing stringent travel restrictions that include temporarily denying entry to foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival in the US.
US citizens returning from China are also subject to health screenings and potential quarantine.
Those US citizens and others traveling to the US from China are being funneled through 11 airports where authorities can conduct additional screening and transfer people for quarantine if needed.
Last summer, as the Ebola virus threat was emerging from the Democratic Republic of Congo, DHS' Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office implemented plans to provide enhanced airport screening at multiple airports throughout the United States.
The department retrofitted its Ebola response plan to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, according to DHS.
Customs officers referred 43,263 air travelers for potential secondary screening since the efforts began on February 2.
Of those referred at airports, 23,836 required secondary screening, according to the data.
Personnel has been added to deal with the virus as well.
Around 95 CWMD contractors are employed per day across the 11 airports to conduct medical screenings.
As of February 12, 19 DHS personnel were assigned to the US Department of Health and Human Services operations center.
There are also 150-200 Customs and Border Protection officers assisting with screening daily at the 11 airports.

17	"Japan has seven new cases of novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Health announced on Tuesday.
About the cases: The new cases include a teen in Wakayama and a male doctor in his thirties who went on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
In Japan, a total of 613 novel coronavirus cases have been confirmed, with 545 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 68 outside the ship.
German researchers called symptom-based screening to detect the novel coronavirus “ineffective” in a new analysis published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers assessed the screening process for 126 people evacuated to Germany from Wuhan, China.
All 126 travelers, mostly German nationals, left Wuhan on February 1 and were screened for symptoms and clinical signs of infection before they were evacuated.
Despite requiring travelers to undergo a multiple screenings once in Germany, two travelers were ultimately positive for the novel coronavirus.
According to the researchers, “a symptom-based screening process was ineffective in detecting” the virus.
During the evacuation flight from Germany, 10 passengers were isolated: two because of contact with a confirmed coronavirus patient; six exhibited symptoms; and two passengers who had accompanied one of the six symptomatic travelers.
Upon arrival, all 10 of these passengers were transferred to University Hospital Frankfurt and all tested negative for coronavirus.
This patient ultimately tested negative for coronavirus.
Of the remaining 115 patients, 114 consented to a throat swab to test for coronavirus.
Of those 114 travelers, two tested positive for coronavirus.
These two patients were isolated at a hospital.
According to the researchers, the two isolated patients were “well” and had no fever in the seven days after hospitalization.
Aside from the ineffectiveness of the screening process, the authors found that the virus could potentially be spread by those who exhibited mild symptoms: “Shedding of potentially infectious virus may occur in persons who have no fever and no signs or only minor signs of infection.” Over 73,000 people around the world have been infected with the coronavirus, most of those cases in mainland China.
There have been more than 1,800 deaths, including five people outside of mainland China.
More than 2,000 people have died from coronavirus across the globe, according to the latest figures released Tuesday.
China’s National Health Commission (NHC) reported Tuesday that 136 more people died of coronavirus in mainland China, 132 of which occurred in the Hubei province.
The latest figures brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to 2,004, and the global death toll to 2,009.
There have been five deaths reported outside of mainland China with one death in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now stands at 75,117, with the majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Since the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak in December, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people and has reached a death toll of 1,868 people in mainland China.
According to analysis done by CNN, travel restrictions, of varying degrees are still being enforced in various provinces and cities across mainland China including Hubei, Liaoning, Beijing and Shanghai affecting over 780 million people.
These restrictions, which appear to be China's main effort to control the disease, include everything from self-quarantines to limits on who can come and go from neighborhoods.
Despite the continuation of its spread, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said that the virus is not as deadly as SARS or MERS, both of which are related to the current coronavirus, and more than 80% of patients ""have mild disease and will recover."" Reports say it could take up to 18 months before a coronavirus vaccine is available.
Here's a look at where the cases are throughout mainland China, according to WHO data.
These numbers may differ from those reported by Chinese health officials, who report updated totals at different times than the WHO.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement criticizing the quarantine efforts taken on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
The CDC noted that there are still more than 100 US citizens on board the ship or in hospitals in Japan.
Due to their high-risk exposure, there is the potential for additional novel coronavirus cases to occur and the remaining passengers who disembark from the ship will  be subject to a 14-day quarantine.
The 13 patients who arrived at the University of Nebraska Medical Center from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are receiving supportive care, Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the hospital's Division of Infectious Diseases, told CNN.
He also noted that while the mortality rate for the virus is being calculated at around 2%, he expects that number to eventually fall.
The Russian government announced that it would temporarily suspend entry by Chinese citizens, according to an order posted on an official state website today.
The statement said Russia would bar entry through its state border to Chinese citizens entering for work, for private, educational and tourist purposes.
The order says the processing of documents, registration and invitations to Chinese citizens to enter Russian territory for those reasons would cease temporarily from midnight Tuesday; the full ban takes effect Thursday.
Some background: This announcement comes amid concerns over the novel coronavirus.
Russia is a major destination and transit point for Chinese tourists, and shares a lengthy land border with China.
The new restrictions will not apply to transit passengers, Russian state news agency TASS said.
The Russian government has reported two cases of the coronavirus involving Chinese citizens in Russia and confirmed that a Russian woman was diagnosed with the virus on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
With a majority of some US medical supplies coming from or originating in China, coronavirus could hold ""chilling implications"" by hindering that pipeline, according to Robert P.
Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.
About timing: The US might not see the impacts just yet because American buyers typically stock up before Chinese factories slow down during the Lunar New Year, Kadlec added.
These concerns extend not just to pharmaceuticals but also to other materials like face masks, which are frequently manufactured in China.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the use of face masks for the general American public.
By buying them up in large quantities, Kadlec warned that Americans might leave fewer for some people who really need them — namely, health care workers.
Kadlec said, ""We probably need to change the way we do business in these areas because of the significant risks and vulnerabilities that are being highlighted by this event."" He added that the solution requires a whole-government approach in cooperation with the private — ""It's everybody."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed, saying, ""We can't see them crash."	2020-02-18

More than 2,100 people have died from coronavirus across the globe, according to the latest figures released Wednesday.
The Hubei health authority reported that 108 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Wednesday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 2,029.
The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,112.
The global death toll from coronavirus has risen to at least 2,120, with eight deaths reported outside of mainland China.
Hong Kong and Iran have each reported two deaths from coronavirus.
Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France have each reported one death.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 76,262, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
People with the novel coronavirus may have the same viral load — or amount of virus in the body — whether or not they are showing symptoms of illness, according to researchers in China.
The letter from the researchers, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, details how the researchers monitored viral loads of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from the nose and throat of 18 patients: nine men and nine women ranging in age from 26 to 76 in Zhuhai, in China’s Guangdong province.
For those samples, a total of 72 nasal swabs and 72 throat swabs were collected and analyzed.
The analysis revealed that higher viral loads were detected soon after a person was showing symptoms, with higher viral loads found in the nose than in the throat.
Yet overall, “the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients,” the researchers wrote in the letter.
It also turned out that, when it comes to viral shedding, the novel coronavirus seemed to resemble influenza more than SARS, according to the letter.
How many affected: Globally, the World Health Organization has reported that there have been more than 75,000 laboratory or clinically confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and more than 2,000 deaths.
Since mid-January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been employing temperature checks at selected airports, at first on people flying in from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and now on all passengers who've been anywhere in mainland China in the past 14 days.
While the CDC has screened more than 30,000 passengers in the past month, not a single US coronavirus case has been caught by airport temperature checks, according to a CNN investigation.
CNN reviewed statements by local, state and federal health officials, and emailed and spoke with officials, to determine how many people eventually diagnosed with the novel coronavirus went through airport temperature checks.
By the numbers: Ten passengers flew into US airports on commercial airliners and were later diagnosed with coronavirus.
Four of those 10 passengers went through temperature checks and were found not to have a fever or any other symptoms of the virus.
Two of those passengers flew into Los Angeles International Airport and two flew into San Francisco International Airport.
Previously, a CDC spokesperson had told CNN that two of the passengers were symptomatic during flight, but the spokesperson later said they were asymptomatic while flying.
Another four out of the 10 passengers were not screened because they flew into airports that did not have screening at the time.
It's unclear whether the final two passengers went through temperature checks because health officials at the CDC and in Wisconsin and Arizona refused to say when asked by CNN.
How the screening works: The temperature checks are part of an overall screening effort that includes giving passengers cards telling them to watch out for fever, cough and trouble breathing, all symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease, also called COVID-19.
While airport temperature checks haven't caught any coronavirus cases, the information cards have helped catch US cases of the virus at least twice – once in a passenger who flew into San Francisco, and once in a passenger who flew into Los Angeles.
The cruise industry is “focused on protecting the health and safety of passengers and crew” amid the coronavirus outbreak, according to the industry’s largest trade group.
“The enhanced screening measures, the first of which were adopted within hours of the WHO declaring a global health emergency, do appear to be working and have enabled operations to continue as usual in many parts of the world,” said Bari Goin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications of Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA.
Goin-Blaugrund also said that within the global CLIA fleet of 272 cruise ships, only one has experienced any cases of coronavirus on board.
Passengers aboard that ship, the Diamond Princess in Japan, began disembarking Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.
A total of 624 cases of the virus are linked to the stricken ship.
Analysts say the coronavirus could take a financial toll on the industry, especially in China.
If operators cancel cruises through March, JP Morgan predicts revenue could fall as much at 15%.
Shares for two of the biggest cruise operators — Royal Caribbean and Carnival — are down more than 16% and 14% this year, respectively.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has calculated a case fatality rate of 2.3% for the novel coronavirus — meaning 2.3% of those known to be infected have died.
And remember: International experts have cautioned that early numbers may not tell the whole story.
Case fatality rates may come down as officials discover milder cases who don't seek medical care.
The president of the company that owns the stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess greeted disembarking passengers in Tokyo on Wednesday, acknowledging that customers had endured a ""challenging"" situation following an outbreak of coronavirus on the vessel.
""This is an unprecedented situation,"" Jan Swartz, President of Princess Cruises, said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.
The Diamond Princess ship became a floating quarantine zone earlier this month.
Dozens of passengers tested positive for the novel coronavirus, effectively trapping more than 3,000 people, including 428 Americans, on board.
A total of 624 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been linked to the boat -- the largest outbreak outside of China.
Japan’s government did not allow the roughly 1,000 crew members to be quarantined unless they took ill, instead asking them to work and serve the rest of the passengers throughout the two-week period.
“I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world really lifted each other's hearts, as did social media play a critical role in that.” ""Our guests shared stories about living in the cabin for 14 days, clearly it was an uncomfortable, challenging situation,"" Swartz added.
Even though the departing passengers have tested negative for the virus and endured the 14-day quarantine, there is mounting evidence from infectious disease experts that they could unknowingly be carrying the virus back into their communities.
On Monday, the United States evacuated more than 300 American passengers who had tested negative for the virus from the Diamond Princess, only to discover that more than a dozen of them were infected.
Canada, Australia and Hong Kong have arranged charter flights to take their citizens home after they leave the ship.
Princess Cruises, which operates a fleet of 20 ships, is the third largest cruise line in the world.
Because of the coronavirus outbreak onboard the Diamond Princess, the company has canceled dozens of sailings, and is moving one of its ships, the Sapphire Princess, from Shanghai to Australia.
Shares in Princess Cruises' parent company Carnival Corporation are down nearly 16% for the year.
Carnival said last week that the hit to global bookings and canceled voyages ""will have a material impact"" on its finances.
Carnival runs its flagship Carnival Cruise Line, the Princess Cruises brand and the Holland America Line, whose fleet includes the Westerdam, a ship that has been linked to one confirmed case of the coronavirus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new travel advisory today for Hong Kong due to the coronavirus outbreak.
This is the only coronavirus-related travel advisory the agency has issued outside of mainland China.
The CDC advises travelers to “practice usual precautions,” in accordance with a “Watch - Level 1” notice of three possible levels.These precautions include avoiding contact with sick people and cleaning hands.
The agency also advises people to seek medical advice if they have spent time in Hong Kong during the last two weeks and feel ill with fever or respiratory symptoms.
The agency currently lists mainland China as “Warning - Level 3” and advises travelers to “avoid nonessential travel.” The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Scientists around the world are slamming and debunking conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus has its origins not in animals, but in a Chinese laboratory, according to a statement published today in the medical journal The Lancet.
""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” wrote the 27 authors, citing studies from scientists in multiple countries that have analyzed the virus’ genetic makeup.
These studies ""overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” What this is about: CNN previously reported statements by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas this week on Fox News saying that “this virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market” and implying that it may have started in a laboratory not far away.
""We don't have evidence that this disease originated there ...
but we at least have to ask the question,” Cotton said."	2020-02-19

Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus in Hubei on Thursday.
The total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak is now 62,442.
By the numbers: The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,233.
The global death toll is at least 2,244, with 11 deaths outside of mainland China.
Japan has reported three deaths from the coronavirus, while Hong Kong and Iran have each reported two deaths from coronavirus.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 76,154 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later today.
Two passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Australia.
Brendan Murphy, chief medical officer for the Australian government, said in a statement that 164 people from the Diamond Princess arrived to the Howard Springs Quarantine Facility on Thursday to begin their 14-day quarantine.
Upon arrival, six passengers were identified to have minor respiratory symptoms and/or fevers.
The six symptomatic passengers were moved into isolation and tested, two of those people have since tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Murphy said both patients ""remain well"" and are being housed in a special isolation unit at the quarantine facility.
Murphy added that ""the development of positive cases after return to Australia is not unexpected"" since there was continued evidence of spread of infection on board the Diamond Princess.
Murphy reassured other passengers and the crew on the Qantas evacuation flight saying that ""all measures were taken to ensure their protection"" and that ""the small number of passengers on the plane meant passengers could be spread out higher risk passengers were seated in separate sections."" The Department of Health reiterated that the two new cases pose no risk to the Howard Spring community and the surrounding communities around the quarantine facility.
Australia now has 17 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus.
Kuwait Airways suspended all flights to Iran on Thursday until further notice and advised its citizens not to travel to Qom following the emergence of coronavirus cases in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait Airways and state news said in a statement.
Kuwaiti Health Ministry said in a statement that it is advising citizens not to travel to the Iranian city of Qom. Those returning from Qom will be put into 14-day quarantine to ensure they do not carry the virus.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) the total global lost revenue for airlines could be $29.3 billion due to coronavirus.
IATA announced that its initial assessment of the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 outbreak — also known as COVID-19 — shows a potential 13% full-year loss of passenger demand for carriers in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The sharp downturn in demand as a result of COVID-19 will have a financial impact on airlines — severe for those particularly exposed to the China market,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new travel advisory today for Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak — the second coronavirus-related travel advisory the agency has issued outside of mainland China.
The CDC advises travelers to “practice usual precautions,” in accordance with a “Watch - Level 1” notice out of three possible levels.
Yesterday, the agency listed the first travel notice outside of mainland China — for Hong Kong, which also carries the “Level 1” advisory.
The agency also advises people to seek medical advice if they have spent time in Japan during the last two weeks and feel ill with fever or respiratory symptoms.
The agency currently lists mainland China as “Warning - Level 3” and advises travelers to “avoid nonessential travel.” The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Chinese officials say the government has taken prudent action in the handling of the novel coronavirus.
China's State Council Information Office held a news conference today to lay out this case.
Yu Xiangyang, the deputy secretary general of State Council, said the city of Wuhan was put under travel restrictions and the Lunar New Year holiday was extended after President Xi Jinping instructed a senior adviser to ""supervise efforts to contain the novel coronavirus."" Yu also said the government mobilized resources and imports after finding daily demand was 15,000 protective suits a day when the supply was only 10,000 suits a day.
Yu said there were not enough hospital beds at first but it was not acceptable to turn suspected cases away.
He said the government established an ""accountability mechanism"" to ensure that ""officials and governments at all levels are held accountable in a city and a province"".
In a bid to ensure accountability, Yu said, ""We will exercise maximum penalty to all those not doing their job well while working on prevention and control of the epidemic” and said the government was conducting “undercover investigations in communities.” Yu went on to say all reported missed cases covered in the media have been investigated by Xi’s adviser, Sun Chunlan, and that all patients involved have been treated.
US health experts are part of a World Health Organization team in China investigating the novel coronavirus outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday during a press briefing.
Tedros said the team on the ground in China includes experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health, as well as experts from Singapore, Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Germany and Russia.
The team includes experts in epidemiology, virology, clinical management, outbreak control and public health, he said.
Team members are working with Chinese counterparts to study transmissibility of the virus and the impact the of measures taken in China, Tedros said.
US health officials have said they made repeated offers, starting in early January, to send health experts to China, and expressed frustration that US experts had not yet been invited in.
A plane carrying Ukrainian citizens and other nationals evacuated from Wuhan, China, arrived today at Kharkiv Airport in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior said in a statement.
The statement said border guards provided clearance for 94 people arriving on the special flight: 22 crew members and accompanying medical personnel, along with 72 passengers.
The ministry said the passengers included 45 Ukrainian citizens and 27 citizens of other countries, including Argentina, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Montenegro, Panama and Israel.
Video released by the ministry showed border control inspectors carrying out their inspections in full protective gear.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky defended the move, describing security measures on the flight as “unprecedented.” Passengers on board the aircraft, he added, were all healthy but would be quarantined and monitored over a period of 14 days at a medical facility belonging to the Ukrainian National Guard in the town of Novi Sanzhary.
In a Facebook post, Zelensky called on citizens to stop “attempts to block routes, block hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens into Ukraine."" There are currently no diagnosed cases of coronavirus in Ukraine."	2020-02-20

Fifty-nine Hong Kong police officers will be quarantined after a 40-year-old male officer tested positive for novel coronavirus on Thursday, according to a statement released by Hong Kong police.
There are 34 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, according to an announcement Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This includes 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 13 US cases.
""We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday.
About the cases: The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China.
There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated.
The 13 US cases include seven in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin.
Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California.
The 13th US case was confirmed overnight in Humboldt County, California.
County officials offered few details but said a close contact with symptoms was also undergoing testing, and both are self-isolating at home.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now track confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States in two separate and distinct groups: those repatriated by the US Department of State and those identified by the US public health network.
What this means: By these new metrics, there are now 21 confirmed cases among repatriated Americans and 13 confirmed cases among Americans first identified on US soil, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease.
Eighteen cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship now back in the United States.
Three cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Wuhan repatriation flights now back in the United States.
Up until yesterday, the CDC was reporting 15 confirmed cases in the United States.
The reason that number has dropped to 13 is because two cases have moved into the case count of repatriated individuals.
Today, 253 people who tested negative for coronavirus after 14 days of quarantine disembarked from Diamond Princess cruise ship, according to the press release from the Japanese Ministry of Health.
The disembarkation of passengers from the ship will continue at least through Saturday, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told CNN.
Nine new cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Japan, bringing the countrywide total to 726, according to the press release by the Japan Ministry of Health.
The total number of confirmed cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship stands at 639 and the number of land-based cases in Japan stands at 87.
China has changed how it counts coronavirus cases in Hubei province three times now — but a World Health Organization official told reporters during a media briefing on Friday that is normal during an active outbreak.
“As long as we understand how things are counted and what the numbers include then it helps us to make the best possible decision to protect the health of people.” Last week, China announced it would count “clinically diagnosed” cases in its tally for Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Then yesterday, the government changed its approach and “clinically confirmed” were excluded from the tally of confirmed cases.
There’s great concern about the spread of the novel coronavirus in countries outside China and among people with no connection to China or Wuhan, World Health Orginization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday.
There’s still a window of opportunity to contain the virus, Tedros said, “but the window of opportunity is narrowing.” WHO is calling on countries to continue containment measures while preparing for community transmission, he said.
He said China’s containment measures in Wuhan and elsewhere are “hammering” the virus and can help contain it.
The outbreak can still go any direction, Tedros said, and countries need to prepare for any eventuality.
Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the World Health Organization's Infectious Hazards Management Department, said the agency is working to prepare countries’ health care workers with training and making sure they know how to protect themselves, and to make sure countries have enough workers to handle a number of cases.
The World Health Organization-led joint mission working on coronavirus in China will travel tomorrow to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said today during a press briefing.
It’s up to the team what it wants to focus on there, Tedros said.
So far, the team has been working Beijing, Sichuan and Guangdong, he said.
Tedros said previously the team includes experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health, as well as experts from Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Germany and Russia.

Israel expanded its restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals to include anyone who has been in South Korea and Japan in the last 14 days, the Health Ministry announced Saturday afternoon.
A Korean Air flight from South Korea landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening.
Only 12 Israelis were allowed off the plane and were immediately taken to their homes, the ministry said.
Approximately 200 foreign nationals were not allowed off the plane.
Last week, Israel announced that any foreign national who had been in Thailand, Singapore, Macau, or Hong Kong in the previous 14 days would be denied entry.
Israel has already barred foreigners who have recently traveled through China from entering the country.
Earlier Saturday, the Health Ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who had been part of a tour group in Israel were diagnosed with coronavirus upon returning to South Korea.
Anyone who came into close contact with the tourists for an extended period of time was instructed to self-quarantine.
Already, 20 workers of Israel's Natural Parks Authority who encountered the tour group will self-quarantine until at least Wednesday, the ministry said.
A class of 30 students and two teachers who came into contact with the tour group will self-quarantine until Thursday.
Another teacher is already being tested at Soroka hospital in Tel Aviv.
Late Saturday, the ministry announced that another group of 60 students and 6 adults, including teachers and security guards, would self-quarantine, after coming into contact with the South Korean tourists.
None of this latest group is showing any symptoms or coronavirus, the ministry said.
The number of people currently infected with novel coronavirus in Italy has risen to 62, with 46 cases in the northern region of Lombardy, 12 cases in the region of Veneto, three cases in Rome and one case in the Piedmont region.
Alberto Cirio, governor of the Piedmont region, announced the latest case on Twitter.
The first death was a 78-year-old man from Veneto region who died at a hospital in Padua on Friday, according to Italian news agency ANSA.
During a press conference on Saturday, the head of the Lombardy health department, Giulio Gallera, said the second patient to die of coronavirus in Italy was a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy.
“We still have to investigate the relation between the death and the virus,” Gallera added.
According to the website of the Lombardy region, train stations of the three villages mostly affected by the coronavirus – Codogno, Maleo, Casalpusterlengo – will be closed from Saturday, with trains no longer stopping there.
Three previous cases from Rome – one Italian and two Chinese tourists – have now recovered.
The US State Department raised the travel alert for Americans to Level 2 on Saturday for travel to South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a release from the department.
The total number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to 55, a spike that is attributed to a rise in cases in the country's north.
This includes 39 confirmed cases in the northern region of Lombardy and 12 in the Veneto region, the head of the Lombardy health department, Giulio Gallera, said at a press conference Saturday.
A 77-year-old female patient with coronavirus was found dead in her Lombardy home, he confirmed.
“We can say she is the second victim of coronavirus in Italy,” Gallera said.
But he added that authorities still had to ""investigate the relation between the death and the virus."" Infections spike: In Lombardy, 35 people tested positive in the town of Codogno, two in the city of Cremona, and two near the city of Pavia, Gallera added.
All public activities have also been suspended in 10 villages south of Milan, Gallera added.
According to the Lombardy region website, train stations in three places affected by the outbreak -- Codogno, Maleo, Casalpusterlengo -- will be closed from Saturday.
“All the people (who) tested positive have been in contact, directly or indirectly with the hospital of Codogno,” the governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said.

The Japanese Ministry of Health has discovered that 23 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were released after their quarantine without being retested, a condition of their release.
“I (feel deep) remorse that an operational mistake invited such a situation and we would like to make sure that such a situation will never occur again,” health minister Katsunobu Kato said during a press conference Saturday.
The ministry also confirmed that one of the ship’s passengers, a woman in her 60s from Tochigi Prefecture in Japan, tested positive for coronavirus after disembarking the Diamond Princess on February 19.
She was among the 443 passengers cleared to leave the ship on the first day of disembarkation after a 14-day quarantine.
She is the first known case of infection after the end of the passenger quarantine period.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN he thinks ""we are clearly at the brink"" of a coronavirus pandemic.
In an interview with CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said: ""Our fate is going to be determined by the ability of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.
And it's going to be very difficult to prevent more cases from coming here to our own country."" Fauci said, however, that the risk to the US is still ""very low,"" but warned that could ""change rapidly."" He also said evacuating Americans off the Diamond Princess cruise ship was a ""difficult decision,"" but he believed it was ""without a doubt the correct decision."" In a strong statement, Israel's health ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who visited the country recently have tested positive for coronavirus upon returning home.
The ministry called on anyone who may have come into close contact with the tour group for an extended period of time to self-quarantine.
The tourists visited some of the most popular sites in Israel and the West Bank from February 8 to 16, increasing the chance of a large-scale exposure in the region, the ministry said Saturday.
Providing a list of dates and locations, the ministry warned that anyone who came within two meters of the group for more than 15 minutes should self-quarantine for 14 days.
The group visited Masada in southern Israel, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.
The potential for a large-scale exposure appears to be high given the number of tourists who regularly visit these sites and others.
The release of the statement on a Saturday is an indication of how seriously authorities are taking the threat of coronavirus spreading in Israel.
Government statements are rarely released on Saturday in Israel since it is the Sabbath.
This comes after Israel announced its first case of the coronavirus on Friday.
The victim is an Israeli woman who returned from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.
She was one of 11 passengers flown back from the Diamond Princess.
All of the passengers remain quarantined in hospital."	2020-02-22

Current global economic growth remains slow with the coronavirus outbreak posing the greatest risk, finance ministers and central bankers meeting at the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia said in a statement.
Despite that outlook, the G20 said that global economic growth is expected to pick up ""modestly"" in 2020 and 2021.
The host of the G20 meeting, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, said that countries will be ready to act on the risk coronavirus poses to commerce.

Israel's ministry of health has announced the country's second case of coronavirus.
A man who was a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who returned to Israel last week, tested positive for the disease.
The first case of coronavirus was announced on Friday.
A woman who had also returned from the Diamond Princess tested positive following a check in Israel.
In addition, the number of Israeli citizens instructed to place themselves under self-quarantine has jumped to more than 700, Ministry of Health Director-General Moshe Bar Siman Tov told Channel 12 News.
More than 300 of those came into close contact with a group of visiting South Korean tourists who tested positive for the disease upon returning home, Siman Tov said.
Another 400 Israeli citizens who have returned from East Asian countries where coronavirus is spreading have also been told to remain home and avoid public spaces for 14 days, in accordance with Ministry of Health instructions.
As of Sunday evening, the Ministry said 18 members of the South Korean tour group tested positive for coronavirus upon returning to their home country.

White House officials are expected to ask Congress for emergency funding this week to battle the coronavirus amid growing fears of a larger outbreak in the US, two officials familiar with the forthcoming request said.
Government aides worked throughout the weekend on the supplemental request, which is still not final but could be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as Monday,  said a person familiar with the plans.
That source said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has ruffled feathers through the process by requesting amounts of money that “have been seen as largely out of proportion.” The source noted HHS already has money that could be used for coronavirus issues, but claimed Azar “has been pushing hard for this to overcompensate” for management decisions regarding coronavirus containment that the source criticized.
By the numbers: The US now has 36 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Fourteen Americans who tested positive for the disease returned to the US this week after spending weeks in isolation on the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess docked in Japan.
The supplemental funding request was first reported by Politico.
Here's a look at where the cases are throughout the world, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data.
These numbers may differ from those reported by national health authorities, who report updated totals at different times than the WHO."	2020-02-23

The Trump administration expects “to allocate at least $2.5 billion in total resources” for the response effort.
Much of that would come from shifting already appropriated money from agency accounts.
The US Food and Drug Administration is currently not able to conduct routine inspections on drugs, medical supplies or household goods from China due the US State Department’s travel advisory for China over the coronavirus outbreak, the agency said in a statement.
Inspections are just one tool the FDA uses to make sure products are safe, and the lack of inspections is “not hindering our efforts to monitor medical products and food safety,” officials said.
The agency monitors products through import screening, sampling and import alerts and it works with US Customs and Border Protection to look for products that violate legal requirements.
Some 60% of FDA-regulated products imported from China are medical devices, the agency said, and 20% are housewares, such as food packaging.
In response to the outbreak, the FDA said it will also use, where appropriate, the agency’s authority to request records from firms “in advance or in lieu of” drug surveillance inspections in China.
Paper records will help prioritize what inspections should happen first during what could become a back log in on-the-ground inspections, depending on how long the travel restrictions continue, the agency said.
The FDA reiterated that there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through imported goods, but added that this is a “dynamic” situation and the agency will continue to assess it and update guidance as needed.
The FDA promised it is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate any coronavirus-related issues in a collaborative effort with other agencies.

Officials in San Antonio, Texas, are reporting they have six patients with confirmed cases of novel coronavirus.
One of the patients is from the group of Wuhan evacuees and five patients are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
The patients with the coronavirus are in isolation at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease.
Nirenberg said he was proud that San Antonio stepped up to help the nation during this “challenge.” “[L]et’s be clear, the most dangerous, damaging infectious disease is hysteria and so what we’re trying to do is make sure we have a compassionate human response to a crisis that’s happening,” the mayor said.
Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of global health protection, said lab results are still pending.
“Given the high risk environment that the Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers came from, I would not be surprised if we have additional cases,” Knight said.

Air Canada is extending its suspension of flights between Canada and Beijing and Shanghai until April 10, and daily non-stop flights from Toronto to Hong Kong until April 30, according to the airline.
However, Air Canada will continue to operate its non-stop flights from Vancouver to Hong Kong, which will accommodate customers originally booked on its Toronto-Hong Kong flights, the airline said.

Watch: While the US Food and Drug is not aware of any shortages of medical products being reported in the United States, it is monitoring some that could be at risk, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told reporters Tuesday.
In particular, the FDA is keeping its eye on personal protective equipment such as face masks and gowns used by health care workers.
The agency is proactively reaching out to hundreds of manufacturers of medical products for information related to these concerns, Hahn said.
More on this: US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said some of the $2.5 billion requested funds would be used to purchase personal protection equipment for the national stockpile.
On Tuesday morning, Azar told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there are 30 million N95 respirators in the Strategic National Stockpile, and the US would need about 10 times that for health care workers.
Hahn also said that the agency is postponing roughly 100 scheduled inspections in China over February and March — mostly routine surveillance inspections meant to ensure that medical products produced in China meet the standards for entering the US marketplace.
But he said these can happen at any time during the year, and the agency is moving things around so they can stay on schedule when it comes to planned inspections for the year.

Hear more: With only 12 state and local health laboratories able to test for the novel coronavirus, public health labs are asking the US Food and Drug Administration for permission to create their own tests for the virus.
The association represents the 150 largest public health labs across the country and is asking the FDA for a special exemption to create its own diagnostics.
“We find ourselves in a situation that requires a quicker local response,” the association wrote.
While the CDC currently has no backlog or delay in testing, the lab association’s CEO, Scott Becker, told CNN that its concern is not about the current situation, but for when community spread of the virus increases.
“We want to encourage and ensure that we have the test closest to the population,” Becker said.
The CDC announced on Feb. 6 that 200 test kits would be distributed to labs across the United States.
The kits needed to be verified by the local health laboratories to ensure they were working.
Less than a week later, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said some labs that had received the tests were getting inconclusive results, and components of the tests would need to be remade.
The CDC has been working to resolve the testing kit issue but has yet to provide a timeline about when labs will receive new tests.
A 70-year-old man is the first person to test positive for coronavirus in Switzerland, the country’s Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told CNN.

There are “ongoing” conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for the novel coronavirus given the rapid spread of the infection in Italy, South Korea and Japan, according to an agency spokesperson.
Currently, the United States is doing health screenings only for passengers who are flying in from China.
At the time that the CDC made the decision to start those screenings, there were far fewer cases of the coronavirus in China as there are currently in Japan, Italy or South Korea.
When the screening started on January 17, there were 45 cases of the new coronavirus in China.
Japan currently has about three times that number of cases, Italy has about 10 times as many and South Korea has more than 25 times as many.
Asked if he was worried about the spread of novel coronavirus in the United States, President Trump said, “No, because we’re ready for it."" “It is what it is.
We’re really prepared,"" the President continued.
""We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world.
We’re very ready for it.
We’re very ready for it.
We hope it doesn’t spread.
There’s a chance that it won’t spread, too.

When you have 15 people — with this whole world coming into the United States — and the 15 people are either better or close to being better, that’s pretty good.” There are now 60 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The current total breaks down to 42 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 15 US cases.
President Trump urged Americans to take the same precautions for coronavirus that they would during a normal flu season.
You don't have to necessarily grab every handrail, unless you have to,"" Trump said.
Trump added that he tries to ""bail out as much as possible"" when he's around anyone showing cold or flu symptoms.
The US has ordered ""a lot"" of masks to deal with a potential coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said.
""We're looking at worst-case scenario, we're going to be set very quickly."" Trump insisted he didn't think the US would end up needing the masks because flights and ""borders are very controlled."" President Trump was just asked if he's considering imposing travel restrictions to and from more countries with coronavirus outbreaks, such as Italy and South Korea.
He added that eventually there could be a ""right time."" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said coronavirus poses a low risk to the American public.
“The immediate risk to the American public is and continues to be low,” Azar said at a White House press briefing.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director for the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said the US should expect to see more cases of coronavirus.
Schuchat urged Americans to prepare for the virus as well as schools and businesses.
""Tt's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities, and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they're ready,"" she said.
She said the future is uncertain, but assured the public that steps have been taken to prepare for such outbreaks.
""So, this — the trajectory of what we're looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.
But many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza and our experience  going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps our health care system, our businesses, our communities and schools may need to take,"" Schuchat said.
President Trump said the Americans who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing “very well.” Trump said he had just been briefed by members of his administration.
“Of the 15 people … eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they’re fully recovered.
And five have fully recovered.
And one we think is in pretty good shape,” Trump said at the White House.
“In almost all cases, they’re getting better,"" Trump said.
He added that there are also patients who were brought back to the US from Japan.
""We took in some from Japan … because they’re American citizens.
They’re in quarantine and they’re getting better, too,” Trump said, adding that they were repatriated because “we felt that we had an obligation to do that.” “We could have left them and that would have been very bad, very bad,” he said.

Trump called his Wednesday appearance before the White House press corps “a really good press conference.” “One of the advantages is that I get covered live,” he added.
“It was a calming press conference.” He also claimed the media won’t give the administration “credit” for a successful response to the coronavirus.

Instead, Frieden stressed what other top health officials have been saying for the past week, that the virus is going to spread in the US.
He said the Trump administration’s request for $2.5 billion to fight the outbreak is key.
“What we can do now is prepare in the society, generally, in our health care settings, in the government – and one of the key things to track in this next week is what happens with the supplemental funding for this, because that will determine how robust the US response can be.” By the numbers: A 15th case of the coronavirus, confirmed in a woman in California on Wednesday, could potentially represent the beginning of the virus’ spread in the community, something the CDC has been warning about for weeks."	2020-02-27

Schwarzenegger called the decision a ""very sad moment for us, for my partners Jim Lorimer and Bob Lorimer, because we have been doing this now since 1976 when we held the first Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe competition in Columbus, Ohio, and ever since we have been doing this without any interruption whatsoever.” The former California governor added, “Let me be very clear that we have the biggest and the best health and fitness festival in the world, but we would never choose making money over people’s health.” The British Columbia Ministry of Health announced three additional confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Canadian province this evening.
This brings British Columbia's coronavirus total to 12, according to Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer.
According to Henry, the new cases include...
The three individuals did not require hospitalization and are recovering in their homes, according to Henry.
By the numbers: These new cases bring Canada’s total number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases to 33, including 20 in Ontario, 12 in British Columbia and one in Quebec.
Vice President Mike Pence pledged that upcoming briefings on coronavirus would be on camera, following a Tuesday evening on the record briefing led by Pence that the White House press office insisted remain off camera.
The press office also insisted that reporters not broadcast any sound from the briefing, in which the vice president announced several new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiatives, including a change in policy that now allows any American to receive a coronavirus test, if a doctor deems it necessary.
When pressed about the briefing being off camera, Pence said it was because President Trump had already made multiple on camera statements today.
""You’re going to see us in here every day answering questions… but the president was at NIH today and the president addressed the country today,"" Pence said.
He added that “I expect we’ll be back on camera tomorrow.” Some context: On two occasions last week, Trump and members of the Coronavirus Task Force briefed reporters on camera from the briefing room.
Now that coronavirus is spreading in the US, lots of people are going to their doctors, urgent care clinics or emergency rooms to find out whether their coughs, sneezes and fevers mean they have the coronavirus.
But some are worried about the cost of that testing after the Miami Herald wrote a story about a man who went to the hospital with flu-like symptoms and was told he might owe $3,270.
(Turns out he actually had the flu, but his limited-coverage insurance policy left him with a $1,400 bill.) Here's how much it will cost you if you seek care: The coronavirus test itself shouldn’t generate a bill – for now – since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is picking up the tab.
That could change as more labs start running the test.
But the visit and other tests aren’t free.
How much you’ll owe depends on several factors, including what insurance you have, where you seek treatment and what tests providers give you.
Going to the emergency room is typically far more pricey than visiting your doctor or an urgent care clinic.
Those feeling sick can call their insurers to learn what the costs they might incur.
State governments and the Trump administration are also looking to relieve the financial burden so Americans don’t hesitate to get checked out — which could worsen the disease’s spread.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday required health insurers in his state to waive any cost sharing associated with testing for coronavirus.
And the Trump administration is looking at providing hospitals with funding to care for the uninsured."	2020-03-03

There are 11 passengers and 10 crew members on the Grand Princess cruise ship that are “symptomatic,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference today.
The ship, which is currently off the coast, is holding hundreds of passengers, Newsom said.
The ship, which departed from San Francisco to Mexico from February 10-21, returned to San Francisco and left for Hawaii on February 21.
Over 50% of the 2,500 passengers from the cruise to Mexico are Californians, Newsom said.
Some of these passengers stayed and went on the second cruise to Hawaii on the same ship.
They are sharing the list of passengers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health care partners to contact all individuals who were on the cruise ship.
The Senate is scheduled to vote on coronavirus funding at 1:45 p.m. ET tomorrow.
The House passed the $8.3 billion coronavirus response package this afternoon in an effort to send billions of dollars to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
The vote was 415 to 2 with just two Republicans voting against the measure; Andy Biggs, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and Ken Buck.
The legislation was formally unveiled this afternoon after lawmakers worked to hammer out a package to respond to the outbreak.
The funding package is far higher than the $2.5 billion the White House requested.
Despite that, however, the White House is expected to back the deal.
A coronavirus vaccine won’t be widely available for a long time, several top pharmaceutical executives said Wednesday.
Early stage clinical trials likely won’t start until the end of the year or in 2021, they said, cautioning that vaccines for previous viral outbreaks, such as SARS and Zika, never made it “over the finish line.” “So that's why we are cautioning people not to overpromise on the timeline of the vaccine availability,” she said, adding that preventing the future spread of coronavirus will take “more than a year and potentially longer than that,"" Gerberding said.
President Trump is pushing drug makers to develop vaccines swiftly, asking pharmaceutical executives on Monday if it could ready in the next few months.
His comments came days after Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a vaccine would hopefully be ready if the virus returns next year.
Johnson & Johnson will likely start phase one trials by the end of this year and begin larger-scale trials next year, said Paul Stoffels, the drug maker’s chief scientific officer.
Some outbreaks, such as Zika, disappear while vaccines are still in the clinical trial stage, Stoffels said.
Big money: Drug makers will likely get federal funding to help develop coronavirus vaccines, testing and treatment.
The House of Representative on Wednesday passed a $7.8 billion spending package that includes more than $3 billion for such efforts.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The proclamation is to help advance resources to help California prepare for a broader spread of the virus.
Newsom said during today’s press conference that the proclamation “is not about money, it’s about resourcefulness.” “Money is not the issue,” Newsom added.
It will also help jurisdiction share information and data, advantageous to address the spread, Newsom said.
What is happening in California: Over 9,400 people are being monitored by 49 jurisdictions, Newsom said."	2020-03-04

The United Kingdom has advised its citizens on Monday “against all but essential travel to Italy, due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus,” according to a statement from Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).
The advisory came after Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a news conference on Monday that the whole country of Italy is now on lockdown.
“British nationals remain able to depart Italy without restriction,” the FCO said.
However, airline schedules are subject to change and some flights are being cancelled,” the FCO added.
People infected by novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure, and almost always within two weeks, according to a study released Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.
That incubation period is consistent with previous estimates from public health officials, and the findings suggest that 14 days of quarantine are appropriate for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used that standard during the current pandemic — recommending, for example, that people self-quarantine for two weeks after traveling to countries with widespread coronavirus transmission, such as Italy or South Korea.
To estimate the incubation period, researchers scoured more than 180 reports of coronavirus in places without widespread transmission of the virus — areas, in other words, where infection was likely due to outside travel.
Because the study was conducted early in the coronavirus epidemic, community transmission at the time was limited to Wuhan, China.
That allowed researchers to estimate the “time of exposure” to the coronavirus by determining when a person was in Wuhan — the only plausible source of infection.
By comparing travel to Wuhan with the emergence of symptoms, researchers could then estimate an incubation period for the virus: usually about five days, and rarely more than 12.
It’s possible, the researchers said, that their study may have focused on more severe cases of the virus – which are likelier to make the news and catch the attention of public health officials.
The incubation for mild cases, then, might differ somewhat.
Of the 80,000 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in China, ""more than 70% have recovered and been discharged,"" according to the World Health Organization (WHO) in a news conference on Monday.

So we saw an overnight reaction of over down 20% and that’s obviously what had a major component today on the stock market,” Mnuchin said Monday at a White House press briefing.
Mnuchin also said the US is moving into the economic bumpiness from a good place.
“We couldn’t be more pleased that coming into the situation with the coronavirus the US has the most resilient economy in the world.

Europe appears to have been largely blindsided by President Trump’s announcement earlier today that the US was suspending travel from 26 European countries.
Several European ambassadors in Washington tell CNN they didn’t know this was coming, despite having been in contact with the administration over the past few days.
One ambassador in DC said there was “no indication” Trump would go to the lengths he did, while another spokesperson said German officials had no advanced warning this was coming.

The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized nine coronavirus tests for emergency use.
The maker of one of those tests, Abbott, promised on Wednesday to ship 150,000 laboratory tests “immediately."" The authorizations are somewhat of a formality.
FDA guidance issued earlier this week allows companies to manufacture and ship tests before receiving permission.
Yet the authorizations still offer a stamp of approval to tests, signaling that federal regulators are satisfied with their validation data and believe their benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.
Four other tests were authorized by the FDA this week; Abbott’s test is the fifth, for a total of nine.
Unlike tests that give results at home or in a doctor’s office, coronavirus tests must be run on specialized equipment in clinical labs.
The Abbott system can process up to 470 tests per day, according to the company, whose test was authorized Tuesday.
The Swiss firm Roche, whose test was greenlit last week, says its systems can process up to 960 results in eight hours.
Such “high-throughput” systems have the potential to dramatically increase testing capacity in the United States.
But shortages of the people and tools needed to run the tests – like health care workers and cotton swabs – could still slow testing."	2020-03-17

""And the Olympics is a major global event.
And I think Japan still has hope the Olympics will happen, but that is going to be based on a risk management decision.

Learning from Italy: ""I think other countries really, really need to step up and learn the lessons that are being learned in Italy right now.
We have to push this virus back.
It's good to have that, it's great to separate people, but we have to be able to go after the virus,"" Ryan said.
Tailoring responses: ""You've got 50 states.
You've got a different situation in each of those states.
And you need to tailor the responses in each of those states.
And if you've got a chance you need to go after the virus.
And contact tracing and isolation of cases is still a strategy that can be used,"" Ryan said.
Question on problems with testing in US: ""If you don't test people, you don't know they're positive.
Therefore, they may be positive and you don't have time to contact trace them because you don't know they have it,"" Cooper said.
Need to identify cases: ""It's really important we identify all confirmed cases.
We need to test suspected cases.
We need those cases to be isolated, and it is difficult in a very intense environment.
It's difficult to do the kind of detailed contact tracing.
In Ebola, at the peak of the outbreak, we were tracing 25,000 contacts a day in the middle of a war zone.
It is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity.

But the threat of spreading coronavirus has prompted the city's public transit system to take additional steps to its already altered scheduled to discourage people from using the public transportation system to go see them during peak bloom.
Trains will be running on a 30-minute operating schedule, and buses will operate on a Sunday schedule, system officials announced in a Friday statement.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority also reminded riders two of its stations — Smithsonian and Arlington Cemetery — close to the Tidal Basin where much of the cherry blossoms bloom will remain closed.
Of course, people continue to show up and look at the bloom, including somebody who broke one of the fragile trees, according to the National Park Service.
Organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival had already announced last week it would be canceling its annual event due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The FDA said it is starting to see unauthorized home tests being marketed by some companies.
The FDA has not authorized any home test, although the agency said it is working with test developers to create one.
The FDA said it has already sent warning letters to companies that were selling and promoting coronavirus related items that were fakes.
The agency said it is also stepping up enforcement at ports of entry, including at international mail facilities.
In a separate investigation, US Customs and Border Protection services seized fake test kits at the Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday.

The government of Italy has made a direct appeal to Defense Secretary Mark Esper for US military aid in combating coronavirus, according to a US defense official.
Specifically, Italy's defense minister has asked Esper for critical medical equipment like masks and ventilators as Italy has nearly 60,000 confirmed cases and has had more than 5,000 deaths.
The Italian government has requested that US military personnel stationed in Italy assist Italian authorities by providing medical personnel and field hospitals in support of Italian troops already responding to the crisis there.
Esper recently made the Defense Department’s stockpile of masks and ventilators available to civilian hospitals in the US to help respond to the pandemic.
The military has activated units capable of constructing field hospitals to help relieve the burden on civilian hospitals.
The Italian plea for assistance from its NATO ally comes as the Russian military has made a very public effort to provide the Italians with assistance, using military aircraft to fly in medical personnel and equipment.

Cuban officials on Monday announced they are limiting travel throughout the island and abroad for their citizens and closed all schools starting Tuesday for nearly a month to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The Cuban government will “regulate” Cubans ability to leave the communist-run island, said Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz, “to protect their health, their family neighbors and work comrades.” Marrero said Cubans would need to present a “humanitarian reason” for travel abroad and for Cubans traveling between different provinces on the island.
Last week, Cuban officials said tourism is banned on the island starting Tuesday and that all Cuban and foreign residents returning from abroad would have to undergo supervised quarantine for 14 days.
Despite that announcement, Marrero said, more than 32,000 foreign tourists remained on the island.
Starting Tuesday, he announced, tourists would be banned from leaving their hotels as the government worked to return them to their home countries.
“No one can go into the street,” Marrero said of the tourists.
School classes would be suspended starting Tuesday until at least April 20, he announced.
All Cubans are required to study in state-run schools.
So far, Cuba has announced the island has 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 1,036 people have been hospitalized for observation.
Marrero also announced that Cubans waiting in “colas” or long lines for hard to find items would need to keep at least one meter (approximately 3 feet) in distance from other people.
He said additional police would be dispatched throughout the island to enforce the new measures.

One of Chicago’s leading children’s hospitals had to scrap plans to host a mobile testing site, which was scheduled Tuesday on the city’s north side after it said both of its vendors weren’t able to fill orders for testing supplies.
It’s another example of how difficult it can be to get tested for Covid-19.
Julie Pesch, spokesperson for Lurie’s Children’s Hospital, told CNN the site was designed to be for pediatric patients not admitted to the hospital who are experiencing symptoms of the virus.
The hospital was hoping to alleviate an onslaught of pressure both its hospital and individual pediatricians across the city are facing.
But because of the high demand for testing and a lack of testing supplies like nasal swabs, those plans were cut short on Friday.
“Our normal operational process is to hold 2-4 days of supply on a product like this.
Last week (March 16) when we went to purchase an elevated quantity, due to the Covid-19 needs, we were informed by both our primary and secondary vendors that they were not able to fill orders,” Pesch said The hospital was hoping parents with an appointment would be able to get a child tested every 15 minutes.
But now the hospital says sick patients will need to go through their regular pediatricians for testing.
The lack of supplies to launch such an effort “is a big deal,” Pesch said.
“The more testing that we can do, that means the less children that we have in the emergency department, in the pediatrician's office.
That is the main message that we’re trying to get across.” “Other hospitals are in the same situation,” said Danny Chun, spokesperson for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association.
The lack of testing supplies remain a problem, he added.
The Advocate Aurora Health hospital system announced Friday that it was suspending a similar program that had already launched because of the national shortage of test kit supplies.

It's not clear, however, whether the company would actually take the funds.
The aerospace giant is among the companies that would qualify for the government-backed loans reserved ""for businesses critical to maintaining national security,"" and the only one that has made it clear that it needs the assistance.

Although the United States government is making every effort to provide necessary supplies in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, supplies will only help so much, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said at a town hall for the American Society of Anesthesiologists on Thursday.
“We will not supply our way out of this problem,” he said.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided 9 million N95 respirators from the Strategic National Stockpile, and it has worked with manufacturers to increase production of N95 respirators to 100 million a month, according to Adams.
He also said the national stockpile purchases 0.1% of all national supplies, while the remaining 99.9% are utilized by commercial and private markets.
Other ways to increase supplies are elimination of elective surgeries and converting anesthesia ventilators to ICU ventilators, according to Adams.
He also talked about the importance of testing.
“By this time next week, we expect to be close to two million tests,” he said.
Other than provision of medical supplies to areas that need them most, Adams reiterated the importance of the general public taking social distancing and good hygiene practices seriously.
According to Adams, the disease runs its course about six to eight weeks after strict social distancing, as seen in China and other parts of Asia.
By decreasing the number of infected people, he explained, the demand for supplies would also decrease.
“The way we get out of this crisis is to lower demand,” he said.
At least 24 detainees at Cook County Jail in Chicago have tested positive for coronavirus, the sheriff's office said in a statement Thursday.
The jail complex currently houses around 5,400 detainees.
A total of 89 detainees exhibiting flu-like symptoms have been tested so far.
Additionally, nine Cook County Sheriff’s Office employees have now tested positive for coronavirus.
Outbreaks have previously been reported in prisons and jails in China, and there have been calls for non-violent prisoners to be released in the US to reduce overcrowding and prevent the spread of the virus among detained populations.
CNN's global town hall on the coronavirus town hall has just ended for the night.
We talked about the situation in China, Europe, and the US, answered questions from our audiences, and had special guests like Bill Gates and Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky.
Scroll through our posts below to catch up on the town hall.
Like all Americans, Katie Ledecky has been forced to adjust her lifestyle under self-quarantine as the country struggles against the coronavirus pandemic.
Ledecky shared how she is training during this challenging time during an interview on CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday night.
One of the motivations for Ledecky to stay in shape are the Olympic games which have been postponed to 2021.
""Goal setting has been crucial to me and keeps me motivated every day to get out of bed and work out hard.
Hopefully that, hopefully we can continue to fight this disease and reduce the spread and be able to compete in Tokyo.
But I think when we get there, it's going to be a true celebration of the world being able to come together again,"" she said.
Countless sporting events have been canceled or postponed around the world over the coronavirus pandemic.
The most notable is the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which has been postponed until 2021.
Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Katie Ledecky joined CNN's ongoing town hall to talk about the postponement.
The next steps forward will depend on the new dates for 2021, which will determine the scheduling for trials and training.
For now, Ledecky is hunkering down and social distancing like everybody else.
""I'm not doing anything besides staying in my apartment trying to stay in shape the best I can,"" she said.
The coronavirus pandemic isn't just having a public health and economic toll on the world -- it threatens our mental health, too.
But there are things we can do to combat feelings of helplessness, panic, depression, and anxiety, said psychiatrist Dr. Christine Moutier on CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall.
If you feel like you want to reach out to a professional for help, but are in self isolation or home quarantine, there are telehealth options and online resources that could offer remote counseling, she added.
With the growing number of coronavirus cases, California is the next New York and New York is the next Italy, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters Thursday.
""In the same way that New York is now the next Italy, and Italy is the next Iran, and Iran is the next China, no matter where you live, you are the next next, this virus doesn't care where you live,"" said Mayor Garcetti, echoing comments he previously made to CNN.
The rate of increase in the number of cases was doubling every three to four days, but today’s number shows a new rate of increase.
Cases are now doubling less than every two days and if this rate continues, we will be where New York is today, Garcetti said.
These are the loved ones that are in our families and our communities and our workplaces,"" Garcetti added.
The mayor also announced that the city is partnering with fashion brand Reformation to help produce masks with guidance from health care company Kaiser Permanente.
The city has launched LA Projects to collaborate with garment and apparel manufacturers to mass produce non-medical masks for non-medical staff at hospitals, grocery workers, and other Angelenos on the front lines.
The goal is to produce 5 million non-medical masks, Garcetti said.
Earlier this week, Hawaii Governor David Ige asked people to postpone their visits to the state for 30 days, and most people are listening.
In a Thursday evening press conference, Ige said flights to Hawaii this week are down 87% compared to the same week in 2019.
""We must try to stop visitors from coming to Hawaii in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 into our communities,” Gov. Ige said The state is backing up its request for fewer visitors with an order that all arrivals -- residents and visitors -- immediately enter a 14-day quarantine upon entering the state.
“Only 38 total people flew into Kauai's airport (Thursday),” said Tim Sakahara with the state’s Department of Transportation.
Arrivals are interviewed before being allowed to leave the airport, and must fill out a form giving details on where they will be spending their quarantine.
Gov. Ige says they are also working with the US Army Corps of Engineers to find places where a field hospital could be set up if one is necessary.
A site survey already has been done at the exhibition hall of Hawaii Convention Center, according to Ige. Please enable JavaScript for a better experience."	2020-03-25
54	"Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has moved here.
Former Vice President got visibly emotional Friday night when discussing how hard it is to not be there for loved ones dying from coronavirus.
Biden referenced his personal history of losing his wife, children and parents.
He continued: ""And seek help.
Seek help afterwards.
Seek help, talk to people who have been through it so they know, they know they can tell you that you can get through it.
That's one of the cruelest, cruelest things that's happening."" Biden closed out the town hall by encouraging anyone struggling with loss to contact his campaign.
Federal health officials on Friday green-lit a point-of-care coronavirus test that can provide results in less than 15 minutes, using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests.
Teased by Vice President Mike Pence in a Thursday press briefing, the new diagnostic could accelerate testing in the United States, allowing for rapid results in doctors’ offices.
But shortages of critical equipment used to collect patient specimens, such as masks and swabs, could blunt its impact.
The US Food and Drug Administration authorized the test for emergency use, signaling that federal regulators were satisfied with the test’s validation data and believe its benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.
The test’s maker, Abbott, said it expects to deliver 50,000 tests per day beginning next week.
The platform used to run the test weighs less than 7 pounds, according to Abbott, and could be deployed “where testing is needed most,” such as at coronavirus hotspots.
More on this: Last week, the FDA authorized another rapid test – one from molecular diagnostics company Cepheid, which provides results in about 45 minutes.
Most laboratory tests for the coronavirus take anywhere from a few hours to days to receive results.
All FDA-authorized tests, however, require samples from patients – and health care facilities say they’re facing shortages of critical supplies needed to collect specimens.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued guidance allowing some patients to collect their own nasal swabs in health care facilities, which could reduce the amount of protective equipment needed for health care workers.
But some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have said that patients with coronavirus-like illness should stay home – saying that is “safer for the patients and health care workers” and doesn’t change the treatment patients receive.
Joe Biden said he would freeze rent for the next three months and forgive the payments missed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Freeze it and forgive it so that you’re able to stay in that place,” the former vice president said in a CNN town hall Friday night.
Biden implied there could be conditions -- noting that enhanced unemployment insurance replacing lost income up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 cash payments approved by Congress this week could replace the income of some people who have lost their jobs, and “then in fact that would take care of it.” Then, Biden added: “There should be a rent freeze.
No one should be evicted during this period -- period.” Today in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a freeze on eviction enforcement and legal proceedings related to coronavirus through May 31.
Joe Biden praised the $2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump today, but worried that the largest emergency aid package in US history might not be enough to save the small businesses ravaged by the crisis.
Biden said the provision in the bill that blocks executives from buying back stock was a good step in assuring that those who need the help get it, but pushed for additional government action if banks don’t start pumping out capital.
They are in a position where we're going to say to the banks you got to get them out the door.
As you know, they're not very good at getting out the door the small business loans,” Biden said.
The former vice president also suggested that, should banks fail to recapitalize those businesses, the White House should consider finding some executive authority – “another version of the Defense Production Act” -- as a way, he said, to “keep the economy in better shape than anything else we're doing.” Joe Biden has run for president essentially promising to be the nation’s healer-in-chief.
He argued during CNN’s coronavirus town hall that America is showing a spirit of togetherness that he hopes will extend well beyond the crisis.
Biden offered an example of a kindergarten teacher in North Carolina who drove from home to home of her students, beeping her horn so they would come out and wave from the driveway for a moment.
He said it took her several hours to get through the neighborhood, but she’s continuing to do it.
Biden, who advanced an initiative to try to beat cancer, said his wife Jill is helping to put together a network to offer support for patients who are dealing with their cancer diagnoses and get through chemotherapy.
“I am so proud, and it sounds corny, but I am proud to be an American,” Biden said.
Joe Biden said Friday that he believes there is “no distinction” between the physical and mental health problems that stem from coronavirus, acknowledging the increasing rates of anxiety and depression as the country uses social isolation to combat the spreading virus.
Biden said he has heard not only about the anxiety that comes from being forced to stay home for long stretches of time, but also the “fear of going into the operating room or the physical fear of pulling someone out of a burning car that, in fact, may also have had the virus.” The comment stemmed from a question clinical psychologist and professor from Chicago, who asked the former vice president about the mental health impact of being socially isolated as the country fights coronavirus.
Biden also said, as president, he would force insurance companies to cover physical and mental health equally and “open a significant number of mental health clinics” in rural America.
“In most rural areas, there's still the same problems as every other area but they don't have these clinics available to them,” Biden said, “so I double the number of mental health clinics that exist.” And, lastly, Biden said he would increase spending on early childhood education because teachers and social workers can “pick up the early signs of distress among students.” There are at least 101,242 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to CNN Health’s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems.
At least 1,588 people have died in the US from coronavirus.
Today there have been at least 402 new deaths reported.
That is the most deaths reported in the US in a single day.
The previous single day high of deaths reported in the US came yesterday.
There were 253 deaths reported yesterday.
Joe Biden said the House and Senate should expand on the stimulus deal Congress approved this week to cover all Americans’ coronavirus-related health care expenses.
“Anything related to the cost of the coronavirus health care should be free, paid for out of the federal funds,” Biden said in a CNN town hall Friday night.
His comment came as he addressed questions about health expenses amid the pandemic.
Biden called on President Donald Trump and Republican state attorneys general to drop their lawsuit challenging Obamacare, through which millions of Americans have health insurance.
He also said he has proposed a plan that would provide coverage through a “public option” to anyone who loses their jobs as a result of a struggling economy.
“But in the meantime, with regard to this virus, you should not have to pay anything for the cost of the virus,” Biden said."	2020-03-26

The Zaandam cruise ship has been given permission to cross the Panama Canal and will then head toward Florida, according to a press release issued by the Panama Canal Saturday.
The green light comes a day after the Panama Canal said on Twitter the Zaandam would not be able to use the canal to get to Florida because the ship had passengers on board who tested positive for coronavirus.
Four ""older"" guests have died on the Zaandam and two others have tested positive for coronavirus.
The cause and manner of death for the individuals who have died has not been determined yet.
More than 130 others have displayed flu-like symptoms, according to the cruise line.
Panama’s Ministry of Health approved the passage of the Zaandam for “humanitarian reasons,” the release said.
No passengers or crew members will be allowed to disembark on Panamanian territory, the statement said.
The ship was scheduled to cross the Panama Canal on April 1, but passage could happen earlier, according to the Panama Canal.
There are a total of 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam.
The ship departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was scheduled to sail to Chile, but has been denied access to ports.
At least 696 members of the New York Police Department have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a daily coronavirus report from the NYPD.
There are 608 uniformed members and 88 civilian members who have tested positive.
About 12% of the department's uniformed workforce -- or 4,342 employees -- were out sick on Saturday, the report said.
President Donald Trump said in a tweet that after consulting with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, he is asking the CDC to issue ""a strong Travel Advisory"" to be administered by those governors, in consultation with the federal government.
Trump said a ""quarantine will not be necessary."" This comes after he said earlier Saturday that he's considering mandatory short-term (two-week) quarantine on New York, certain parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.
Trump's suggestion of a mandatory quarantine was strongly opposed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who questioned whether it would be legal.
More than 2,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States as of 7:45 p.m. EST Saturday, according to a CNN count compiled through data on state health department websites.

A nurse at a downtown New Orleans hospital has described to CNN the very difficult conditions at the facility.
The nurse, who did not want to be identified out of fear that speaking to the media could lead to employment repercussions, described the situation at the hospital after finishing a shift two days ago.
The nurse told CNN that while the situation at the hospital is dire, the staff are in better shape than some.
We only have 16 unused ventilators left in hospital.
We’ve been told the surrounding hospitals are at max capacity without ventilators, leaving our hospital and one other major hospitals left to care for these patients,"" the nurse said.
""EMS are having to recruit volunteer EMT workers to help as New Orleans EMS paramedics are either in quarantine for exposure or sick themselves."" A physician assistant working in the emergency room of a hospital in the New York borough of Queens described an ""every man for themselves"" atmosphere surrounding personal protective equipment (PPE).
CNN is not naming this health care worker because they feared repercussions at the hospital for speaking to the media.
This physician assistant told CNN staff were informed two days ago that they would have to make their N95 mask last for five days and that they have been given tips by management about how to keep them clean.
PPE is being prioritized for those staff working with intubated patients, who are the most at risk of infection, the physician's assistant said.
Intubation is when a tube is inserted through the mouth and into the patient's airway, so the patient can be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing.
The physician assistant hasn't heard when the hospital will receive more supplies.
The physician assistant described a crowded ER that is essentially doubling as an intensive care unit due to the large numbers of people who need to be intubated due to Covid-19.
“There’s patients everywhere,"" the physician assistant said.
""I think that no one ever expected to need this many supplies in a short period of time,"" the worker said.
The ER worker emphasized that they felt the hospital administration and management's support of staff has been ""pretty impressive"" and that they have been checking in on the ER staff's needs, even helping staff members find hotel rooms so that they do not need to go home and possibly sicken their families.
The physician assistant wanted to emphasize to the public the importance of social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus.
""You need to stay home, you need to stay away from people” they told CNN.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN he would sue Rhode Island if they did not roll back a policy of stopping all cars with New York license plates, but that he expects the two states will be able to work it out amicably.
""That clearly is unconstitutional,"" Cuomo said, adding he understands Rhode Island's goal of trying to slow the spread of coronavirus.
""But there's a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at the point of absurdity.
Again, it is not even legal,"" he said.
No state should be using police to prohibit interstate travel in any way, Cuomo said."	2020-03-27

Amazon employees at the company’s facility in Staten Island, New York, plan to walk off the job Monday amid allegations the online retail giant has mishandled its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The walkout will begin at 12:30 p.m. and could involve anywhere between 50 and 200 people, said Christian Smalls, an assistant manager at the facility who is leading the walkout.
Following the walkout, the workers will gather at a nearby public bus stop and speak to the press.
Employees are protesting Amazon’s decision to keep the Staten Island warehouse open despite news of a confirmed case of the virus there last week, Smalls said.
Many more employees have tested positive for the virus at the facility than the company has publicly acknowledged, Smalls said, claiming that as many as five to seven workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus.
US stock futures were lower Sunday night after President Donald Trump announced an extension of the social distancing guidelines to April 30.
Dow futures were down 371 points, or about 1.7%.

After the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of self-swab testing for the novel coronavirus, it will be implemented this week, said Adm. Dr.
Giroir, assistant secretary for US Department of Health and Human Services during a White House press conference Sunday evening.
With this approval, people with suspected coronavirus can use a foam swab in their nose to collect a nasal sample that they then would put in a plastic bag and submit for testing.
Self-swab testing not only could be more comfortable for the general public, but Giroir said that it also eliminates the need for health care workers to change their personal protective equipment each time a test is performed.
""Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose, that's uncomfortable but it also requires PPE changes every time it's done,"" Giroir said.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said during a Sunday briefing at the White House that ""we've reviewed 12 different models"" in deciding whether to continue the social distancing guidelines.
Birx emphasized that officials brought ""that data and that evidence to the President to consider for extending, which is not a simple situation when you ask people to stay home for another 30 days."" ""They have to know that we've really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save really hundreds of thousands of American lives,"" she said.

Two weeks after San Francisco issued the country’s first shelter in place order for residents to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus, hospital emergency rooms throughout the region appear to be seeing the early effects.
As of Monday morning, the city reported a total of 374 confirmed infections and six deaths from the virus.
While the availability of testing is still much lower than officials would like, the modest daily count compared to other major urban centers may be an encouraging sign that the early aggressive action in the country’s second most densely populated city is having its intended effect.
“We have already made a difference in saving lives,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said during a news conference Monday, though she and other officials repeatedly cautioned that US communities are still in the early stages of the battle against the virus.
""We’re watching the data very carefully,” added Dr Grant Colfax, the city’s public health director, cautioning that the numbers could still explode rapidly.
The situation in Los Angeles: But that sense of hope has not necessarily reached Los Angeles County, where hospitals are seeing a steady increase in the number of patients.
Close to 2,500 people are confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus in the county, with 342 new cases reported in the past two days.
Across town at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, doctors expressed more optimism in the early efforts.
“We are cautiously hopeful that there has been a flattening of the steep curve because we have not seen the exponential rise of traffic coming in,” said Dr Anish Mahajan, the hospital’s chief medical officer, referring to the rate of new transmissions.
Harbor-UCLA has seen a steady rise in coronavirus patients in recent days, increasing from 12 patients on Thursday to 35 on Monday.
What the authorities say: At a news conference Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked if officials were beginning to see a flattening of the curve of coronavirus patients.
It would be too easy to say what has or has not worked,” Newsom said.
“The stay home effort has bought us time to prepare.” California currently has at least 5,763 coronavirus cases, including 118 deaths.

But the governor said Illinois had so far received only a “small fraction” of what the state had asked for.

A plane from Russia loaded with personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies to assist in the response to Covid-19 is expected to arrive in the United States on Wednesday, a senior administration official tells CNN.
President Trump on Monday told reporters that Russia sent the US “a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment which was very nice.” Why is Russia sending the equipment?
The Russian embassy in DC tweeted Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin provided the assistance with the consideration that manufacturers would reciprocate and share supplies with Russia if need be.

President Trump on Tuesday again touted anti-malaria drugs as a potential treatment for coronavirus, and extolled their safety, despite the lack of scientific studies on the matter.
Facts First: Trump is right that the drugs have been available for a while, but he’s wrong to imply that they’ve been proven safe for Covid-19 patients.
Public health officials have said testing is still needed, and trials are underway.
Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for doctors to use the drugs in hospitals for a limited set of Covid-19 cases.
Some physicians have already been using the malaria drugs off-label to treat coronavirus patients.
The drugs have been used to safely prevent and treat malaria, and for lupus and other conditions.
But there isn’t scientific data proving that they’re safe for coronavirus patients.
There’s no evidence to back up Trump’s assertion that it’s already known that Covid-19 patients won’t die from the treatment.
The drug can lead to cardiac side effects, including an irregular heartbeat, which can be especially dangerous for patients with Covid-19, doctors say.
Early tests are underway now in New York, the hardest hit area in the US with more than 75,000 cases.
This isn’t the first time Trump has made this comment.
His messaging on the drugs have been far more optimistic than the messaging from the public health officials that have attended the daily White House briefings."	2020-03-30
59	"Residents of Los Angeles should wear non-medical grade face coverings when in public, the city's mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news conference Tuesday.
Garcetti emphasized that all medical-grade N95 masks were reserved for front-line workers in hospitals and clinics.
Face coverings, like a bandanna, are only effective with safe physical distancing, he added.
There are currently 8,155 cases of the virus in California.
Global debate on face masks: Despite the regular use of masks in Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Western governments have been slow to embrace them to stop the spread of the virus.
But with the number of new cases remaining low or stable in Asia, it appears that more countries in the West may change their approach.
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the UK and Canada were making plans to repatriate their citizens from two Holland America cruise ships currently off the coast of Florida.
Two cruise ships off Florida coast: Both the Zaandam and the Rotterdam are currently on their way to Florida, and have requested permission to disembark guests.
Since March 22, 83 passengers and 136 crew onboard the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Eight passengers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Four people on the Zaandam have died, but the cause of their deaths is unknown.
On the Rotterdam, 14 passengers have exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Deborah Birx said a coronavirus antibody test could be available “within this month” and says “I've really called on every university and every state to develop ELISA’s, you can buy the antigens and the controls online, and really work to test entire health care communities in your state and support them that way.” The ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, test detects and measures antibodies in blood.
If successful, the test could help identify those who have already had the virus, but have since recovered.
Experts say that if a person has had the virus and developed antibodies, it will most likely mean they have built up immunity and the chances of that person being infected again drops dramatically.
Birx said that the test could help identify frontline medical workers who may have had the coronavirus and not know it.
Birx said a first test could be available, “soon, within this month if the universities help us, absolutely.” There have been at least 917 new coronavirus deaths reported in the US on Wednesday, according to a count by CNN Health.
This is the most reported deaths in the United States in a single day since the coronavirus outbreak.
There have been a total of 4,745 deaths reported in the US since the outbreak.
Wyoming remains the only state in the US without a death from coronavirus.
So far, there are 137 positive cases in the state, according to CNN's tally.
Adam Schlesinger, a prolific songwriter for film and television and co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, has died from complications of Covid-19.

The Fountains of Wayne song ""Stacy's Mom,"" a pop hit from 2003, was among the group's most popular songs.
The Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships are expected to arrive and remain off the coast of Florida early Thursday while they wait for clearance from US authorities, according to a statement from Holland America.
The company made a plea to President Trump, Florida authorities and the public to be allowed to arrive to Florida.
The cruise line called the status on the ships a “humanitarian situation.” Four people on the ship have died and at least eight people have tested positive for Covid-19.
Since March 22, 97 guests (83 on Zaandam and 14 on Rotterdam) and 136 crew on the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms, according to the statement.
These passengers would stay isolated on board until they recover, per the press release.
Holland America says less than 10 people need immediate critical care onshore and it has secured a local health system to treat them.
When asked Wednesday evening during a coronavirus task force briefing why he didn't issue a universal stay-at-home order for the entirety of the country, President Trump implied that some states are basically fine when it comes to the disease.

Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, recently purchased 1.2 million N95 protective masks to donate to the state of Massachusetts and another 300,000 for New York state.
He joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to explain how it got done.
Kraft explained that his eldest son, who is the chairman of the board of Massachusetts General Hospital, is close with the state's governor, Charlie Baker.
Baker asked if there was a way that the state could get the masks bought in China.
So Kraft offered to use the team's jet, which was sitting idle.
Kraft said he believes both Baker and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was on CNN at the time, were both doing a great job.
Gov. Cuomo said the call he got from Kraft saying they were getting the extra masks was probably ""the only good call I've gotten in about 10 days."" Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus today, bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329.

Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 response, chimed in on the current debate about when to wear face masks and who should be wearing them.
""What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks -- medical masks, not N95 masks with respirators.
Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients,"" she said.
""We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks,"" she said.
She said right now, it's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers.
The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks.
US health officials recommended the same, but may be shifting course.
On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection.
Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days.
When asked about President Trump's suggestion that people use facial coverings like scarves, Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating.
""We are constantly looking at evidence, all the time, for the use of masks for anything that is related to this and related to health issues.
We are talking with scientists around the world, including US CDC scientists,"" she said.
Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said currently there is no evidence that the coronavirus can spread long distances.
However, she added that the virus could spread through a defective plumbing system.
At the Amoy Gardens housing estate, there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building.
Dr. Wen also recommended opening the windows to increase your own ventilation once the weather gets warmer and to wash your hands thoroughly after touching surfaces that are used often, like handrails or buttons in elevators.
Peru will allow men and women out on separate days as part of a gender-based quarantine measure designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The new measures will begin in Peru today, President Martin Vizcarra announced to the nation on Thursday.
So far, Peru has reported 1,414 cases of coronavirus and 55 deaths.
It comes two days after Panama began restricting movement by gender, arguing the measure urges people to return home since their loves ones are not allowed to be outside.
Peru said it would adopt the same system following the positive results the gender-based measure has yielded in other countries and due to its simplicity in visually detecting who should and shouldn't be out on the streets, Vizcarra explained.
Cheryl from Jacksonville, Florida, asked CNN's coronavirus town hall if Covid-19 can be contracted by ingesting it from produce at a supermarket.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said that since the virus is respiratory, you can't get it from contaminated food.
But you are not going to get a GI type thing from eating the virus."	2020-04-01
